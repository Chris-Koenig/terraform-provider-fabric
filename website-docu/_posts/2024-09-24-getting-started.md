To use the Terraform provider for Microsoft Fabric, three key requirements are needed:

1. **A Microsoft Fabric instance**  
   Ensure you have access to a properly configured Microsoft Fabric instance.

2. **An Azure Service Principal**  
   You need a Service Principal with the required permissions to modify your Fabric environment.

3. **A local installation of Terraform**  
   Install Terraform on your local system to apply the configurations.
